## 🏗️ Architecture

The application adheres to **Clean Architecture** principles to promote separation of concerns and create a highly maintainable codebase. The core business logic is independent of frameworks and external interfaces.

The project structure is organized into the following layers:

```
subscription-api/
├── application/
│   ├── entities/                 # Domain entities (innermost layer)
│   ├── usecases/                 # Business logic and application services
│   ├── interface-adapters/       # Controllers, gateways, and external API adapters
|   |   |── aws-s3-adapter/       # AWS S3 integration
|   |   ├── connect-adapter/      # Visma Connect integration
│   │   ├── controllers/          # REST API controllers
│   │   └── gateways/             # Database access layer
│   └── external-interfaces/      # External systems and infrastructure
│       ├── boot/                 # Spring Boot application
│       └── databases/            # Database configurations
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Java 21** or higher
* **Maven 3.6+**
* **MySQL 8.0+** running locally or an accessible Aurora MySQL instance for development

## ⚙️ Building and Running

### Build the Application

Compile the code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file.

```bash
mvn clean install
```
### Run the Application
Launch the application using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. The correct configuration will be loaded based on the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable.

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -pl application/external-adapters/boot
```

### Run Tests
Execute the unit and integration test suite.

``` bash
mvn test
```

## 🐳 Containerization with Jib

This project uses Jib to build optimized Docker images directly from Maven without a Dockerfile.

### Build a Local Docker Image
This command builds an image named subscription-api and saves it to your local Docker daemon.

```shell
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:dockerBuild -pl application/external-interfaces/boot -Dimage=subscription-api
```
### Build and Push to AWS ECR
This command is used in CI/CD pipelines to build the image and push it directly to an Amazon ECR repository.

```# Replace {awsAccountId} with your AWS Account ID
./mvnw compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:build -pl application/external-interfaces/boot -Dimage={awsAccountId}.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/subscription-api
```
## 📖 API Documentation & Health

Once the application is running, you can access the API documentation and health check endpoints.

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

OpenAPI Spec: http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs

Health Check: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

## ☁️ Infrastructure
The infrastructure for the test environment is provisioned on AWS (Account ID: `602259772901`).
  
The current infrastructure is managed with `Terraform`, and the code is available in the `subscription-api-infrastructure` repository. There are ongoing plans to migrate this setup to a common infrastructure based on `Terragrunt` and `OpenTofu`.
